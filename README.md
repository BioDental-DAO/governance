**BioDental DAO** is a patient-governed initiative based in Costa Rica. We are building the first decentralized clinic dedicated to biological dentistry, where protocols are transparent, and patient data is sovereign.



# governance
The open-source operating system for the BioDental DAO. A decentralized global clinical service model for biological dentistry bridging Web3 incentives with oral microbiome research, and regenerative healing. Advancing Natural Philosophy in oral health through decentralized governance, patient-led research and plant-based autonomy.

## 🗺️ Roadmap: From Code to Clinic

Our path to bridging Natural Philosophy with Decentralized Healthcare.

### Phase 1: Genesis (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)
*Focus: Digital Infrastructure & Governance Architecture*
- [x] **DAO Inception:** Define Mission, Vision, and Manifesto.
- [x] **Repository Launch:** Initialize GitHub with dual-licensing structure.
- [ ] **Governance V0:** Release the "Whitepaper" outlining the tokenomics and voting weight.
- [ ] **Community Onboarding:** Launch Discord and activate the "Welcome Bot" workflow.
- [ ] **Core Team Assembly:** Recruit initial Medical Stewards and Technical Contributors.

### Phase 2: Aggregation & Treasury (Q2 2026)
*Focus: Community Building & Seed Funding*
- [ ] **Genesis NFT Mint:** Release "Founding Member" membership passes to fund initial treasury.
- [ ] **Legal Wrapper:** Establish the legal entity (LLC/Co-op) in Costa Rica/Wyoming to interface with the physical world.

### Phase 3: Materialization (Q3 2026 - Q4 2026)
*Focus: The Physical Node in Costa Rica*
- [ ] **Site Acquisition:** Secure lease/purchase of the flagship clinic location in Costa Rica.
- [ ] **Equipment Procurement:** Import biological dentistry equipment (Ozone generators, CBCT, etc.).
- [ ] **SOP Publication:** Publish the first open-source "BioDental Clinical Standard Operating Procedures" on GitHub.
- [ ] **Soft Launch:** First patient treatments (Beta) for DAO members.

### Phase 4: Propagation (2027+)
*Focus: Scaling & Data*
- [ ] **Patient Data Locker:** Launch the Web3 patient portal for sovereign medical records.
- [ ] **Token Generation Event (TGE):** Full launch of the governance token for broader decentralization.
