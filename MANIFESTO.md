# The BioDental Manifesto
### Restoring the Roots of Health through Natural Philosophy & Decentralization

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Living Document
**Date:** December 2025

## I. Preamble

Modern dentistry has drifted from its origins in healing. It has become mechanical, compartmentalized, and often toxic—treating the tooth as an isolated object rather than an integral part of a living biological system.

The **BioDental DAO** is a rejection of this isolation. We are a return to **Natural Philosophy**: the rigorous, holistic study of nature and life. We believe that oral health is the gateway to systemic vitality, and that the knowledge of how to heal should be open, shared, and owned by the community, not sequestered behind corporate patents.

We are building a new model: **A Patient-Led, Open-Source, Biological Dental Ecosystem.**

## II. Our Core Axioms

### 1. The Mouth is a Mirror
We reject the separation of dentistry from medicine. The mouth is the primary interface between the internal body and the external world. We treat the root cause, not just the symptom. We prioritize biocompatible materials, ancestral nutrition, and the preservation of the oral microbiome.

### 2. Sovereignty Over Biology
A patient’s health data is their property. In the BioDental DAO, medical records are not siloed in a filing cabinet; they are encrypted, sovereign assets owned by the patient. We use Web3 technology to ensure that if a patient contributes their data to research, they share in the value that research creates.

### 3. Science Must Be Open (DeSci)
True science is "Natural Philosophy"—it thrives on transparency. We commit to the principles of **Decentralized Science (DeSci)**. Our protocols, from ozone therapy standards to herbal pharmacology (e.g., *Azadirachta indica* usage), are open-source. We do not hoard knowledge; we fork it, test it, and improve it globally.

### 4. Governance by Stakeholders, Not Shareholders
The incentives of a clinic should align with the health of its patients. By organizing as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), we shift power from private equity to the community. Dentists, researchers, and patients all hold a stake in the success of the ecosystem.

## III. Strategic Objectives

1.  **The Physical Sanctuary:** To establish a flagship biological dental center in **Costa Rica**, serving as the physical node for our network and a destination for medical tourism.
2.  **The Digital Commons:** To build and maintain a GitHub-based repository of "Standard Operating Procedures" (SOPs) for biological dentistry that any dentist in the world can use and improve.
3.  **The Research Loop:** To fund and execute peer-reviewed research on ancestral oral care techniques, the oral-gut-brain connection in systemic health and plant-based oral microbiome probiotics, bridging indigenous wisdom with modern pharmacology.

## IV. The Invitation

We invite the outliers. 
We invite the dentists who know there is a better way to heal. 
We invite the patients who seek ownership of their health journey. 
We invite the developers who want to code for a higher purpose.

We are not just fixing teeth. We are restoring the root.

**Join us.**
