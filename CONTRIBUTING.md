# Contributing to BioDental DAO

First off, thank you for considering a contribution to the BioDental DAO. You are helping to build the world's first open-source operating system for biological dentistry and Natural Philosophy.

We welcome contributions from everyone—whether you are a React developer, a holistic dentist, a herbalist, or a patient advocate.

## 🏛️ The Two Paths of Contribution

Because this project bridges technology and medicine, there are two distinct ways to contribute. Please follow the path that matches your expertise.

### Path A: For Medical Professionals & Researchers 🦷
*You want to improve clinical protocols, add research on plant pharmacology, or edit the Manifesto.*

**You do NOT need to be a coder to help.**
1.  **The "Issue" Method (Easiest):**
    * Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues).
    * Click "New Issue."
    * Select the **"Clinical Protocol Proposal"** template.
    * Describe the protocol, research paper, or correction you want to add.
    * *Example: "Proposed adjustment to Ozone Therapy duration standards based on 2025 study."*
2.  **The Direct Edit:**
    * Navigate to the file you want to change (e.g., `protocols/ozone-therapy.md`).
    * Click the "Pencil" icon in the top right.
    * Make your edits and click "Commit changes." This automatically creates a Pull Request for us to review.

### Path B: For Developers & Engineers 💻
*You want to improve the governance smart contracts, the patient portal, or the onboarding bot.*

1.  **Find a Task:** Look for Issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
2.  **Fork the Repo:** Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page.
3.  **Branch:** Create a branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
4.  **Commit:** Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`).
5.  **Push:** Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`).
6.  **PR:** Open a Pull Request against our `main` branch.
